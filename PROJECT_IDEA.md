# Project: Local Data Lister

## üë• Team Information
- **Team Members**: Giga Goriashvili
- **Selected Base Project**: Local Data Lister

## üéØ Project Vision
**Problem Statement**: Users need a quick, accessible, and easily filterable way to find information about local points of interest (e.g., restaurants, parks, events) through a web application, requiring a persistent and flexible data storage solution for easy data management.
**Target Users**: Individuals seeking local information (e.g., tourists, new residents, locals looking for specific services or entertainment). Also, implicitly, developers learning full-stack data flow with NoSQL databases.
**Value Proposition**: Provides a clear, organized, and filterable display of local information, leveraging a flexible NoSQL database (MongoDB) for scalable and adaptable data storage. For the developer, it serves as a robust demonstration of fundamental full-stack web development concepts, including persistent server-side data management, client-side data consumption, and interactive list filtering, all within a type-safe environment.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Technical Design

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript (using Mongoose for MongoDB OGM)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Deployment**: AWS (EC2 for backend, S3 for static frontend assets, MongoDB Atlas for database hosting)
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest (for API integration tests)

### System Architecture
- **Component Hierarchy**:
    - `App`: Main application container.
    - `Header`: Contains application title and potentially the search bar.
    - `SearchFilter`: Input field and logic for filtering the list.
    - `LocalItemList`: Container component responsible for fetching data and rendering `LocalItem` components. Handles filtering logic.
    - `LocalItem`: Displays individual local entity details (name, type, address, description).
    - `LoadingSpinner`/`ErrorMessage`: Basic UI for data fetching states.

- **API Design**:
    - **Endpoint**: `GET /api/local-items`
        - **Description**: Retrieves a list of all local data items from MongoDB.
        - **Request**: No parameters.
        - **Response**: `200 OK` with an array of `LocalItem` objects.
        ```json
        [
            {
                "_id": "60d0fe3d8f8d9f0015b6d517", // MongoDB _id
                "name": "Central Park",
                "type": "Park",
                "address": "123 Park Ave",
                "description": "Large urban park with walking trails and playgrounds.",
                "tags": ["outdoor", "nature", "family"],
                "__v": 0 // Mongoose version key
            },
            {
                "_id": "60d0fe3d8f8d9f0015b6d518",
                "name": "The Gourmet Grill",
                "type": "Restaurant",
                "address": "456 Main St",
                "description": "Fine dining restaurant specializing in grilled meats.",
                "tags": ["food", "dinner", "steak"],
                "__v": 0
            }
        ]
        ```
    - **Data Flow**:
        1. Frontend (`LocalItemList` component) makes a GET request to `/api/local-items` upon component mount.
        2. Node.js backend connects to MongoDB (via Mongoose), queries the `localitems` collection, and retrieves the documents.
        3. Backend sends the retrieved data as a JSON response.
        4. Frontend receives the data, updates its state, and renders `LocalItem` components.
        5. User interacts with `SearchFilter` to update the displayed list (filtering happens client-side).

- **Database Schema (MongoDB Document Structure)**:
    - While MongoDB is schema-less, we'll define a robust Mongoose schema to enforce structure and enable type safety.
    ```typescript
    // In backend/src/models/LocalItem.ts
    import { Document, Schema, model } from 'mongoose';

    export interface ILocalItem extends Document {
        name: string;
        type: 'Restaurant' | 'Park' | 'Event' | string;
        address: string;
        description: string;
        tags: string[];
    }

    const LocalItemSchema: Schema = new Schema({
        name: { type: String, required: true },
        type: { type: String, required: true },
        address: { type: String, required: true },
        description: { type: String, required: true },
        tags: { type: [String], default: [] }
    });

    export const LocalItem = model<ILocalItem>('LocalItem', LocalItemSchema);
    ```
    - Frontend interface will mirror this structure (excluding Mongoose specific fields like `_id`, `__v` or handling them as optional).

- **Authentication**: No user authentication required or implemented as per the project's scope. The application serves publicly accessible data.

### Key Design Decisions
-   **MongoDB as Primary Data Source**: Utilize MongoDB for persistent storage of local item data. This provides flexibility for evolving data structures and simplifies data management compared to static files. Mongoose will be used for schema definition and interaction.
-   **Client-Side Filtering**: All filtering and search logic will be handled on the frontend (React). This offloads processing from the server, minimizes database queries for every filter change, and demonstrates React's capabilities for dynamic UI updates.
-   **TypeScript End-to-End**: Leverage TypeScript across both frontend and backend to enforce strict type checking for data structures (`LocalItem`), API request/response contracts, and component props. This enhances code quality, readability, and maintainability.

## üß™ Test-Driven Development Strategy
- **Core Features to Test**:
    - Backend MongoDB connection: Verifying successful connection and disconnection.
    - Backend API endpoint: Verifying it returns the correct data structure and HTTP status from MongoDB.
    - Frontend data fetching: Ensuring data is correctly fetched, loading states are handled, and error conditions are displayed.
    - List rendering: Confirming that fetched items are correctly displayed in the `LocalItemList`.
    - Filtering/Search functionality: Testing that the list filters accurately based on various inputs (partial matches, case-insensitivity, no results).
    - Individual `LocalItem` component: Testing its rendering with various data inputs.
- **Testing Approach**:
    - **Unit Tests**: For isolated backend utility functions, Mongoose models, individual React components (e.g., `LocalItem`, `SearchFilter`).
    - **Integration Tests**: For backend API routes (using Supertest to hit actual endpoints), frontend data fetching from the backend, and interaction-based tests for filtering.
    - **End-to-End Tests**: (Optional, if time permits) Using Cypress to simulate user flow from initial load to filtering.
- **Test Coverage Goals**: Focus on achieving high coverage (e.g., 80%+) for core logic pathways, including database interactions (read), data fetching, data transformation, list rendering, and the client-side filtering algorithm.

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy
- **AWS Services**:
    - **EC2**: Host the Node.js backend server.
    - **S3**: Store static frontend assets (HTML, CSS, JS bundles).
    - **MongoDB Atlas**: Managed cloud database service for MongoDB instance.
    - **CloudFront**: Optional, for CDN and SSL for S3 content (can use Nginx on EC2 instead for simplicity if managing one server).
    - **Route 53**: Optional, for custom domain mapping.
- **Environment Variables**: Manage sensitive configurations (e.g., MongoDB connection string, port numbers) using `dotenv` for local development and direct environment variables on the EC2 instance for production.
- **Database Hosting**: MongoDB Atlas (recommended for ease of setup, scalability, and security compared to self-hosting MongoDB on EC2).
- **Domain & SSL**: If a custom domain is used, configure Route 53. SSL will be managed via Nginx on the EC2 instance using Let's Encrypt, or via AWS Certificate Manager if using CloudFront.

## ü§î Potential Challenges & Solutions
-   **Challenge 1**: Setting up and connecting to MongoDB Atlas and managing connection strings/IP whitelisting.
    -   *Solution approach*: Follow MongoDB Atlas documentation carefully for cluster creation, user setup, network access configuration, and obtaining the connection string. Store connection string securely via environment variables.
-   **Challenge 2**: Ensuring Mongoose schema validity and handling potential data inconsistencies (even though MongoDB is schema-less, Mongoose enforces it).
    -   *Solution approach*: Define a clear, well-structured Mongoose schema. Use TypeScript interfaces to enforce data shapes. Implement robust error handling for database operations.
-   **Challenge 3**: Managing and seeding initial data into MongoDB for development and deployment.
    -   *Solution approach*: Create a simple Node.js script to connect to MongoDB and insert initial mock data (e.g., from a JSON file) into the `localitems` collection. This script can be run once after deployment or as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
